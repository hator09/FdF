# FdF

## üó∫Ô∏è FdF ‚Äì Wireframe Map Renderer
FdF is a 3D wireframe renderer written in C using the MiniLibX graphical library. It reads a map from a file, where each number represents a height value (z-axis), and displays a 3D projection of that map in a 2D window.

### This project is part of the 42 School Common Core curriculum and focuses on:

- Reading and parsing structured input data.

- Using matrix transformations and projections (isometric, parallel).

- Drawing lines using Bresenham‚Äôs algorithm.

- Handling keyboard events for interaction (zoom, movement, rotation).

- Understanding the basics of computer graphics.

### ‚ú® Features
- Isometric projection of 3D maps

- Zoom in/out and move around the map

- Rotate the map around multiple axes

- Real-time user input with keyboard controls
